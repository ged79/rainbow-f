#### 5. **Logging & Monitoring** ✅

### 📱 How to Test

#### Test Authorization:
```javascript
// Try to complete an order not assigned to your store
// Should get: "이 주문을 완료할 권한이 없습니다"
```

#### Test Mobile Camera:
1. Open the app on a mobile device
2. Navigate to an order assigned to your store
3. Click "배송 완료 처리"
4. Click the photo upload area
5. Camera should open automatically

#### Test Notifications (when SMS API ready):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test/notification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "010-1234-5678"}'
```

### 🔧 Configuration Needed

#### For SMS Notifications:
Add to `.env.local`:
```env
# SMS Provider (Aligo example)
SMS_API_KEY=your_api_key
SMS_USER_ID=your_user_id
SMS_SENDER=1234-5678
SMS_API_URL=https://api.aligo.in/send/

# For testing
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 📁 Modified Files

1. `/src/app/api/orders/[id]/complete/route.ts` - Main completion API
2. `/src/components/OrderCompletionModal.tsx` - UI component
3. `/src/services/notifications.ts` - NEW: Notification service
4. `/src/app/api/test/notification/route.ts` - NEW: Test endpoint

### 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If any issues occur:
```batch
# 1. Stop the application
# 2. Restore from backup
xcopy "C:\work_station\backup_client_2025_01_27" "C:\work_station\flower\apps\client" /E /H /C /I /Y
# 3. Restart application
```

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Only receiving store can complete orders
- [x] Cannot complete cancelled orders
- [x] Cannot complete already completed orders
- [x] Required fields enforced (recipient_name, note)
- [x] Photo upload errors displayed
- [x] Mobile camera opens on mobile devices
- [x] Completion data saved in consistent format
- [x] Logging works for security events
- [ ] SMS notifications work (pending API keys)

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure SMS Provider:**
   - Sign up for Aligo or similar Korean SMS service
   - Add API credentials to environment variables
   - Test with real phone numbers

2. **Database Migration (Optional):**
   ```sql
   -- If old completion_photos field exists, migrate data:
   UPDATE orders 
   SET completion = jsonb_build_object(
     'photos', completion_photos,
     'completed_at', updated_at,
     'note', 'Migrated from old system'
   )
   WHERE completion_photos IS NOT NULL 
   AND completion IS NULL;
   
   -- Then drop old column:
   ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN completion_photos;
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Check photo upload success rates
   - Monitor completion times
   - Track authorization violation attempts

### 📊 Success Metrics

Monitor these after deployment:
- Photo upload success rate (target: >95%)
- Average completion time (target: <2 minutes)
- Mobile camera usage rate
- SMS delivery rate (when enabled)

### 🎉 Implementation Status: SUCCESS

All requested features have been implemented except SMS notifications which require API credentials. The system is now more secure, consistent, and mobile-friendly.
