### **3. Data Saving/Loading Functions:**
All these fields are now properly:
- **Saved** to localStorage in `handleSaveRoomInfo()`
- **Loaded** from localStorage in `loadRoomData()`
- **Reset** in `handleReset()`

## **What Was Kept:**

### **✅ Improved Status Board Display**
The 현황판 still shows:
- Deceased information directly on cards
- Family members by relationship
- Schedule information
- Photo if uploaded
- Traditional Korean funeral hall format

## **Testing Checklist:**

1. **Test Data Input:**
   - [ ] Enter all deceased information fields
   - [ ] Add multiple family members
   - [ ] Set all schedule times
   - [ ] Upload photo
   - [ ] Enter business information

2. **Test Data Persistence:**
   - [ ] Save the data
   - [ ] Navigate to 현황판
   - [ ] Verify data displays on card
   - [ ] Navigate back to room
   - [ ] Verify all fields retained

3. **Test Reset Function:**
   - [ ] Click 초기화
   - [ ] Confirm all fields cleared

## **No Breaking Changes:**
- All original functionality preserved
- Only added missing fields back
- Status board display improvements intact
- Data structure backward compatible

The app now has both:
1. **Complete data insertion functionality** (restored)
2. **Improved status board display** (kept from update)
